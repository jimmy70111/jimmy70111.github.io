        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>My name is Jimmy, and I just graduated from Temple University this summer. I have experience in both front-end and back-end development using various programming languages. Using these experiences, I was able to mentor 10+ undergraduate students to develop a better understanding of coding concepts and data structures. Last summer, I worked as a software engineer intern at Labware. This experience allowed me to understand what working in a professional setting looks like.</p>
